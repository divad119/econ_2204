    2.  the rendered output (the `.pdf` file).
-   Unless told otherwise, write your answers directly under each question.
-   Some questions ask you to use chunk options so that only results appear (not code).
-   This exam is closed book. No notes, texts, phones, or other study aids are allowed.
-   The use of generative AI is strictly prohibited

# Questions

1.  Getting Started \[5 Marks\]
    (a) Create an R project entitled econ_2204 and connect it to your GitHub account. Make sure you click Create git repository.
    (b) Within the econ_2204 directory on your local computer, add a new folder called quiz_1.
    (c) Add the Quiz 1 files to the quiz_1 directory.
    (d) Insert the link to your GitHub repository.
2.  Quarto Basics
    (a) In the YAML at the top of this file, replace `YOUR NAME` with your name. \[1 Mark\]

    (b) Put the following words in the appropriate font:

        (i) Bold \[0.5 Marks\]

        -   **bold**

        (ii) Italics \[0.5 Marks\]

        -   *italics*

        (iii) Code \[0.5 Marks\]

        -   `code`
3.  Write the following equations using LaTeX math syntax so that they render properly. Write them using display math. \[2 Marks each\]

> (a) The simple linear regression model: $$
>     Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i + u_i
>     $$

> (b) The sample mean: $$
>     \bar{X} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i
>     $$
>
> <!-- -->
>
> 3.  Insert an image using Markdown image syntax. \[5 Marks\]
>
> -   Use the image in the uw-logo-centre-stack-black.png file, but it must render
> -   Add a caption that reads: Figure 1: University of Winnipeg Logo. ![Figure 1: University of Winnipeg Logo](uw-logo-centre-stack-black.png)
>
> 4.  Insert an R chunk and add an Image Using R. Use the `echo: false` execution option, so that the code does not show in the PDF. <!-- -->
>
> <!-- -->
>
> (a) Generate a variable $x=(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)$ \[1 Mark\]
> (b) Generate a variable $y= 2x+5$ \[1 Mark\]
> (c) Create a simple plot with $x$ on the $x$-axix and $y$ on the $y$-axis using the `plot()` function.
> (d) Add a figure caption "Simple Plot of $X$ Versus $Y$" using the quarto execution command `fig-cap`.
> (e) Add the label `fig-scatterplot` using the `label` execution command
> (f) Reference the plot in a sentence below the plot

> 5.  {r} 
      - #\| echo: false 
      - #\| fig-cap: "Simple Ploy of X Versus Y" 
      - #\| label: fig-scatterplot 
      - x \<- c(1:10) 
      - y \<- 2\*x+ 5 plot (x, y) 
      - As shown in Figure @fig-scatterplot, Y increases linearly with X. <!-- -->
>
> <!-- -->
>
> (a) Create a data frame using `data.frame()` called `students` with columns `name` and `grade` with the following rows:

| name | grade |
|------|-------|
| Ana  | 82    |
| Ben  | 75    |
| Cara | 91    |
| Dan  | 68    |

> We want the code to print in the PDF, so set `echo: true`. Compute and print the average grade. 
{r}
#\| echo: true
students <- data.frame(
  - name = c("Ana", "Ben", "Cara", "Dan")
  - grade = c(82, 75, 91, 68)
)
students
  - average_grade <- mean(students$grade)
  - average_grade

6.  Commit the finished quiz to your GitHub profile \[1 Mark\]
